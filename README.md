## Problem 1: Brute Force (15 pts)

Write a function named median_string(dna,k) that takes in a set of dna sequence strings named dna and k-mer length k. This function should implement the “better” version of brute force motif finding discussed in lecture and described on p. 82. Note: best practices suggest that you would want to also create a function for calculating d(Pattern, Dna), and possibly other functions to solve this problem.

 

## Problem 2: Greedy Algorithm (15 pts)

Write a function named greedy_motif_search(dna, k) that implements the GreedyMotifSearch pseudocode on p. 86 of the textbook. Be sure to use LaPlace Succession when calculating counts, profile, and score. Note that the argument *t* in the pseudocode refers to len(dna), so we don't need to include it as an argument in our solution.

 

## Problem 3: Random Algorithm (15 pts)

Write a function named randomized_motif_search(dna,k) that implements the RandomizedMotifSearch pseudocode on p. 94 of the textbook. Be sure to use LaPlace Succession when calculating counts, profile, and score. Note that the argument *t* in the pseudocode refers to len(dna), so we don't need to include it as an argument in our solution.

 

## Problem 4: Gibbs Sampler (15 pts)

Write a function named gibbs_sampler(dna, k) that implements the Gibbs Sampling algorithm (textbook p. 101) for motif finding. Be sure to use LaPlace Succession when calculating counts, profile, and score. Note that the argument *t* in the pseudocode refers to len(dna), so we don't need to include it as an argument in our solution.
